To create or advance a release, simply run `make release VERSION='$semver'`, e.g.

* `make release VERSION='1.2.3'
* `make release VERSION='1.2.3-rc1'

To run the process without pushing the changes to GitHub, run the command with `dryrun=true`.

Make sure you set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) which has
at least `public_repo` access to your repository.

By default, the action will try to push to the GitHub account used in the `origin` remote.
If you want to use a specific GitHub account, set `GITHUB_ACTOR` to the desired account, e.g.

* `make release VERSION='1.2.3' GITHUB_ACTOR='octocat'`
